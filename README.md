# DISCLAIMER

I am deeply skeptical of crypto, and the tech underlying crypto. But I want to better understand it, so here is a repo of some experimentation.

# Run Local

`yarn chain` from scaffold-eth or another directory to run a local dev version of the Ethereum blockchain

`yarn start` to run the script in index.js
