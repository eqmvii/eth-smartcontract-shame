# DISCLAIMER

I am deeply skeptical of crypto, and the tech underlying crypto. But I want to better understand it, so here is a repo of some experimentation.

# Run Local

`yarn chain` from scaffold-eth or another directory to run a local dev version of the Ethereum blockchain

`yarn start` to run the script in index.js

# Handle eth

Use the scaffold faucet to send eth to 0xcbc4efe8CCf05a9435089e2F8F68622abBb7642e
in order to have funds to interact with the smart contract.
